              <p class="about-intro">
                Welcome to Ceyhun Demir Guitars! I am passionate about providing high-quality guitars and accessories to musicians of all levels.
              </p>
          
              <h3 class="hhstar">About Me</h3>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                My journey with wood and sound began in childhood. From an early age, I was drawn to carving and shaping wood—what started as play gradually became a lifelong passion.
              </p>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                Over the years, that passion evolved into a deep respect for craftsmanship and the art of instrument making. As both a performing musician and a trained luthier, I’ve always tried to build instruments not just with precision, but with a feel for how they will respond in the hands of another musician.
              </p>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                Studying instrument making at university gave me the technical foundation, but it’s the hours in the workshop—immersed in the quiet rhythm of the process—that taught me the most. When I’m building an instrument, I lose track of time. Each curve, each joint, and every piece of wood receives my full attention.
              </p>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                For me, creating an instrument is not just about assembling parts—it’s about bringing something to life that will carry sound, soul, and stories for years to come.
              </p>
